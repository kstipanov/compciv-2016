Automated Gender Analysis of Carnegie Museum of Art

Introduction

Carnegie Museum of Art is a prestigious museum of contemporary art in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. Art, generally, is a male-dominated profession and a male-dominated world. I expected that a museum of contemporary art would have collected more art by female artists in the last twenty years than an art museum without a contemporary focus would have. This gender analysis shows that in the years between 1960 and 1980, only 8 percent of the new collected objects in this time were produced by female artists. In the years between 1995 and 2015, only 21 percent of the new collected objects in this time were produced by female artists. I expected that the collected objects between 1995 and 2015 would include a larger percentage of women as producers, but the results agreed with my hypothesis that the percentage of women artists collected would increase from the twenty year span 1960-1980 to the twenty year span 1995-2015.

Methodology

The methodology of the gender detection is similar to that of the babynames-gender-detector homework.
